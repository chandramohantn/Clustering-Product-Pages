Clustering-Product-Pages

Introduction

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the
same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Cluster analysis as such is
not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective
optimization that involves trial and failure. It will often be necessary to modify data preprocessing and
model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.
The topic of product clustering is central to providing a good user experience, intelligent search,
and revenue for e-commerce web sites.Companies like eBay and Amazon do not require the merchants
to provide a product category it is automatically deduced, allowing scalability and reducing deliber-
ate or unintentional mis-classication, thus enhancing user experience, customer satisfaction and higher
transaction rates.

Objective

Cluster the e-commerce sites' web pages based on the product category. With the given dataset, we are
trying to come up with some set of clusters that will take the description of the products from the web
pages and try to build some clusters based on that.
Web page clustering is one of the major preprocessing steps in web mining analysis. In data mining,
preprocessing is a key task to ensure reliability and quality of the knowledge extracted by the whole
mining process. As the amount of data to process is potentially infinite if dynamic web pages are con-
sidered, the need of preprocessing this information seems necessary to deal with this computational
problem. Considering individual pages could also not provide additional information.

Description of dataset

Dataset is a collection of random web pages from e-commerce sites with each site having description
about a product. There are also web pages which contains description of a single product as well as list
of products. The dataset contains about 2870 web pages.Data is unlabeled.All product pages (including
duplicates) were used for clustering in order to verify performance on a large datase.The dataset is provided
by Indix. Indix ,is a company which is attempting to build the world's broadest and deepest product catalog
to enable every app and website to become product-aware.
